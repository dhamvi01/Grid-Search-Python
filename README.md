# Grid Search Python

Parameter and hyper parameter are vital for any model building. The pre-build model comes with parameters to tune it according to dataset. To get optimum accuracy it's essential to tune parameter properly

As one model is having multiple parameters it's important to find out best pairs of parameters. With the help of gridseach we can get the best paarameter set, For that we have to prepare diction containing parameters as key and it's different value as list for keys# Grid Search Python
